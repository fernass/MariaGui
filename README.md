# MariaGui
This is a QT project creating a graphical user interface for processing huge datasets and categorising them into clusters based on pre-defined keywords.
The data are imported from csv files. Each line is a data set.
There is a TableView for the datasets and another for the categories - connected to a dialogue for defining the categories and their keywords.
There is a statistics window summarising the clusters.
